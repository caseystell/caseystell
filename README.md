### Hi, I'm Casey ğŸ‘‹

A little about me:

- ğŸ”­ I'm a fresh software engineering bootcamp grad looking for any entry-level professional opportunities.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my learning of data structures and algorithms and working on a few special-interest personal projects.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that can further the reach and resources of marginalized communities.
- ğŸ§˜ Fun fact: I am a 200-hour certified yoga teacher, and I love practicing and deepening my knowledge of yoga!
